      <section>
        <h2>1. Be flexible with dates and destinations</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest savings comes when you travel outside peak seasons or choose less obvious destinations. Mid-week flights are often cheaper than weekends; late evening or early morning departures may offer bargains. Consider secondary airports or lesser-known towns that offer similar experiences at lower cost.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Use fare-alert tools and compare across airlines</h2>
        <p>Set price alerts on flight search engines so you’ll get notified when fares drop. Don’t just stick to one booking site; compare direct airline sites and travel aggregators. Some travel agencies offer “opaque” fares which can be cheaper but may come with more restrictions.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Stay in affordable alternatives to hotels</h2>
        <p>Accommodation can consume the biggest chunk of your travel budget. Consider guesthouses, hostels (many now with private rooms), vacation rentals, or homestays. In many places, budget stays are comfortable and offer local flavor. Even staying a few nights in a mid-range place and the rest in budget lodging can help.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Embrace local food and transport</h2>
        <p>Eating at local markets, street food stalls or cafés instead of touristy restaurants makes a big difference. Use public transit, bikes or shared rides instead of always taking taxis. Walking tours, free museums, and local festivals can offer memorable experiences without costing much.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Travel light and avoid hidden fees</h2>
        <p>Packing smart avoids baggage fees and hassle. A carry-on only approach may save you money and time. Read airline baggage policies carefully. Also, always check whether your booking includes taxes, seat-selection or baggage — low headline prices may hide extra costs.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Book smart and consider day trips</h2>
        <p>Sometimes staying in one base for longer and doing day trips outwards saves money compared to hopping each day. Booking early can lock in better prices but sometimes last-minute deals are available — if you’re flexible. Use traveller discount cards, city passes or local tourist cards which bundle multiple sights at lower price.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Maximize loyalty points and travel hacks</h2>
        <p>Even for budget travellers, earning and redeeming travel rewards (credit cards, airline points, hotel loyalty) helps. Use free perks from apps (e.g., travel check-in, notifications, ancillary discounts) and don’t ignore “extras” that cost little but add value like free walking tours or museum hours.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Stay safe and prepared</h2>
        <p>Budget travel sometimes involves trade-offs. Prioritize safety: check reviews, read cancellation policies, keep digital copies of reservations, and consider travel insurance. Unplanned costs can wipe out savings if something goes wrong.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Budget travel is not about doing less; it’s about doing more with what you have. With flexibility, research, smart choices and awareness, you can experience great destinations, meet new cultures and come home with stories—not bills. It’s not about paying the least; it’s about getting the most value for your journey.</p>
