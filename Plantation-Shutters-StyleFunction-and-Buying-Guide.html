      <p>Plantation shutters are a classic window treatment that combine timeless style with excellent light control and privacy. Characterized by wide louvers (the horizontal slats), they work in traditional and contemporary interiors and are available in a range of materials, finishes and configurations.</p>

      <h2>Why choose plantation shutters?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Light control & privacy:</strong> Tilt the louvers to filter daylight while keeping privacy, or close them fully for darkness.</li>
        <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Quality shutters (wood or composite) last for years and resist warping better than standard blinds.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy efficiency:</strong> When closed, shutters add an insulating layer at the window, helping reduce heat loss or gain.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean, built-in look:</strong> Shutters are custom-fit to the window frame for a polished, architectural appearance.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy maintenance:</strong> A quick dusting or wipe keeps them looking fresh.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common styles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Full-height:</strong> Panels cover the entire window from top to bottom — great for uniform coverage and a formal look.</li>
        <li><strong>Café style:</strong> Bottom half covered, top half open — excellent for daytime privacy while keeping natural light.</li>
        <li><strong>Tier-on-tier:</strong> Separate top and bottom panels that operate independently for maximum flexibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Solid panels / Panel shutters:</strong> Fewer louvers or solid sections for a more traditional shutter appearance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Materials</h2>
      <p>Shutters are typically made from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wood:</strong> Real hardwood offers natural warmth and can be stained or painted. Best for dry, climate-controlled rooms.</li>
        <li><strong>Composite / faux wood:</strong> Engineered materials that mimic wood but resist moisture and warping — a good choice for bathrooms and kitchens.</li>
        <li><strong>Vinyl / PVC:</strong> Budget-friendly and moisture resistant, though usually less premium in appearance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Measuring, installation & costs</h2>
      <p>Plantation shutters are most commonly custom-made to fit your window openings. Many providers offer in-home measuring and installation; DIY options exist but require careful measuring and some carpentry skill. Prices vary widely depending on material, louver width, number of panels and whether installation is included — expect a higher upfront cost than blinds, but longer lifespan and added home value.</p>

      <h2>Care & maintenance</h2>
      <p>Routine care is simple: dust with a microfiber cloth or vacuum with a brush attachment. For deeper cleaning, wipe with a damp cloth and mild soap (check manufacturer recommendations for wood vs. faux wood). Avoid excessive water on real wood.</p>

      <h2>Buying tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Decide on louver width: wider louvers (e.g., 3.5"–4.5") look modern and provide a clearer view when open; narrower louvers suit smaller windows.</li>
        <li>Choose material by room: faux wood for moist rooms, real wood for high-end living areas.</li>
        <li>Ask about warranty, lead times and whether the price includes measuring and installation.</li>
        <li>Consider color: classic white brightens a room; stained wood adds warmth and texture.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="meta">Whether you’re renovating or simply upgrading your window treatments, plantation shutters add lasting style, control and value.</p>
